# Neovim_coasters

PCB coasters containing keyboard shortcuts for the Neovim text editor

Work in progress

Give the Gerber.zip to your favorite PCB fab together with some money and receive nerdy coasters.

Word of advice: Some PCB fabrication processes add a layer of lead on top of the exposed metal contacts on board. Avoid those kinds of processes. Gold ENIG plating is probably the safest choice for using these as coasters for your mug. 

I TAKE ZERO RESPONSIBILITY if you make these or have these made for you and something bad happens. PCB's are not food safe
